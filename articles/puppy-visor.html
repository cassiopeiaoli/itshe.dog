                <div class="text">
                    <p>Hi!!</p>
                    <p>
                        It wanted to talk about a project It's currently working on: a visor! You probably know what
protogens are - you can think of this project as of something similar to a protogen, 
but way simpler (it thinks?)!
                    </p>
                    <p>It wants a puppy muzzle with electronics installed in it which include:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>two 8x8 WS2812b LED matrixes for the eyes</li>
                        <li>a MPU6050 Gyroscope and Accelerometer </li>
                        <li>A touch button</li>
                        <li>one 4x4 WS2812b LED matrix for the mouth</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It actually already built a working prototype (at least the electronics)! And one of the
thingies that was MOST difficult to interface with were the WS2812b matrixes! For the
prototype, this one used a library it found on github, but it proved to be very, very
troublesome to work with on a bigger scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What it wants is:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>being able to refresh the framebuffer for the matrix</li>
                        <li>clear the matrix</li>
                        <li>display animations on the matrix</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While the aforementioned library worked, interfacing it with puppy's code was extremely difficult and produced
very nasty code with many, many hacks. Since this one wants the visor to be puppy's first <b>BIG</b> project, it wants the code
to be as clean as possible, no place for dirty hacks!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another issue was that this library was the only piece of code it has not written itself, which it felt bad about. It always
wants to understand every piece of equipment it uses, and since STM32F411 is this one's first bigger MCU it wants to <b>learn,</b> and
it's not going to learn if it uses libraries for stuff!

                        WS2812b LEDs
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        !!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets finally talk about the main topic of this article - the WS2812b LEDs :3
                    </p>
                    <img class="article-image" src="img/ws2812btiming1.png" alt="Timing diagrams for sending logical ones and zeroes to WS2812b LEDs">
                    <img class="article-image" src="img/ws2812b.png" alt="Timing diagrams for sending logical ones and zeroes to WS2812b LEDs">
                    <p>
                        Those are timing diagrams for the WS2812b LED. Each LED takes <b>24 bits</b> of data, and each bit is a signal that lasts <b>1.25us</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, if we want to send a <b>logical zero</b>, we want to keep the signal high for <b>0.4us</b> and low for <b>0.85us</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And if we want to send a <b>logical one</b>, we want to keep the signal high for <b>0.8us</b> and low for <b>0.45us</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After each 24 bits we need to send a low signal for <b>at least</b> 50us, it's very important!! If we don't send this signal after each
                        24 bits (or the signal we send is too short) it can confuse the WS2812b and produce <b><i>MIND BOGGLING EFFECTS</i></b> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        WS2812b after you send it incorrect reset signal:
                    </p>
                    <img  src="../assets/img/borzoigaming-borzoi1.gif" alt="">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As you can see, each LED has a <b>DIN</b> and <b>DOUT</b> pin, they're all connected to each other! This allows us to use only <b>one wire</b> to drive
                        those LEDs, quite neat!!!!!!!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To create such specific signals we'll have to use <b>Pulse Width Modulation</b>, and we will throw <b>DMA</b> in here for good measure as to not block the MCU :3
                    </p><br>
                    <h3>Timer configuration!</h3>
                    <p>Here it will configure TIM1 for PWM and DMA :3</p>
                    <p>One important info: Puppy's STM32F411 runs on external oscillator built into its blackpill (25MHz). Given you use a different
                        oscillator or a different clock speed, you'll have to use different values for <b>counter period</b> and other values in order 
                        to send correct signals to WS2812b!!!
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/tim1.png" alt="" class="article-image">
                    <p>
                        And that's literally it when it comes to timer configuration :3 Now lets look at DMA!
                    </p>
                    <img src="img/dmaled.png" alt="" class="article-image">
                    <p>
                        We <b>must remember</b> to set direction as <b>Memory to Peripheral</b> since we're sending data from our MCU to the matrix :3
                        We also use <b>normal mode</b> and data width of <b>half-word.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>And... That's actually it when it comes to configuration! Lets write some code already :3c</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>Code!!!! We're writing code!!!!!!!!</h2>
                    <p>
                        Do keep in mind that this is a very <b>general way</b> of interfacing with WS2812b! You'll probably have to introduce interrupts
                        for transfer completion to be able to do more complex things ^^
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lets start by defining our framebuffer :3c
                    </p>
                    <img src="./img/code.png" class="article-image" alt="">
<p>
    Your immediate question might be: why is FRAMEBUFFER an array of 3-length arrays? If we look back into the WS2812b datasheet, we can see this:
</p>
<img class="article-image" src="./img/datastuff.png" alt="">
<p>
    As we can see, those 24 bits are composed of three parts for <b>green, red and blue!</b> All of those are made of 8 bits, and our framebuffer
    just holds data for those different colours, for each LED! Also <b>remember</b> that WS2812b accepts this data from MSB -> LSB!!
</p>
                </div>
            <p>
                abababababab!!!! Time to write functions!!
                             
            </p>

            <p>
                Rebarkable,,, truly! This is a function we're going to use to set individual LEDs within our matrix :3c
            </p>
            <p>Lets try sending data to the matrix now!</p>
            <img src="./img/code2.png" alt="" class="article-image">

            <p>
                What happens here:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>We go over all LEDs</li>
                <li>For each LED, we go in a loop backwards (remember how WS2812b accepts data!)</li>
                <li>if a bit in a color variable is set, we send a high pulse, otherwise we send a low pulse</li>
                <li>After that, we send fifty 1.25us pulses (this gives us 62,5us for reset signal :3)</li>
                <li>We start the DMA transfer :3c</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h2>...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h2>
            <p>Lets visit our <b>main</b> function and add this:</p>
