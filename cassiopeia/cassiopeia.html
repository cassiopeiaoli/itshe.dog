<h3>Clicker - a silly SSG written by my paw</h3>
<p>2025-04-28</p>
<p class="mt-4">
Today I finished a very SIMPLE SSG that I wrote in <i>C</i>! It uses a very stupid doggy syntax. The funny thing about this piece of software is that I wrote it after I took ADHD meds for the first time, and I stayed up to 5 AM to get it finished lmao.

Anyhow, the repo is here, the code is bad but it works -w-
